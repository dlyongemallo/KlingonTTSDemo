# Klingon Text-To-Speech Demo
Simple demo of the Klingon Text-To-Speech (TTS) Engine.

This shows the minimum amount of code needed to call the Klingon TTS Engine from within your app. Most of the code is boilerplate generated by Android Studio.  Code actually added for the demo of the TTS engine are preceded by the comment "// TTS:".
